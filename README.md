# Hi-Lo
Hi-Lo is a Poker-like strategic card game featured in the TV show "Devil's Plan," where players use numerical and operator cards to formulate equations targeting values close to 1 ("low") or 20 ("high"), betting in rounds similar to Poker based on the outcomes of their equations.

Currently at the most beginning of development. Now just as Jupyter notebook, soon with GUI as a browser/mobile game.
